## Ethereum to Cosmos asset transfers

Before starting the Ethereum relayer, you must set up the application ([steps](./initialization.md)) and deploy the Peggy contracts to an Ethereum blockchain ([steps](./local-ethereum-usage.md)). You must have both the application and Ethereum blockchain running before you'll be able to relay assets between the two.

### Setup

Create `.env` with sample environment variables for the Cosmos relayer:   

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Start the Relayer service on local Ethereum blockchain

For automated relaying, validators can run a relayer service which will automatically watch for relevant events on the Ethereum network and relay them to the Bridge. Note that your local web socket and registry contract address may vary.

```bash
# Open a new terminal window

# Check ebrelayer connection to ebd
ebrelayer status

# Start ebrelayer
# Use the contract address returned by `yarn peggy:address` for [PEGGY_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS]
# Note that you may need to update your websocket's localhost/port
ebrelayer init ethereum ws://127.0.0.1:7545/ [PEGGY_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS] validator --chain-id=peggy

# Enter password and press enter

# You should see a message like:
#   Started Ethereum websocket with provider: ws://127.0.0.1:7545/
#   Subscribed to bridgebank contract at address: 0xd88159878c50e4B2b03BB701DD436e4A98D6fBe2

# The Relayer will now listen to the deployed contracts and create a claim whenever it detects a new lock event
```

### Lock Ethereum assets on contracts

Now we can lock our funds on the contracts by sending a lock transaction containing Eth/ERC20 assets. First, we'll use default parameters to lock Eth assets.  

Default parameter values for lock transactions:

- [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] = `cosmos1pjtgu0vau2m52nrykdpztrt887aykue0hq7dfh`
- [TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] = `eth` (Ethereum has no token contract and is denoted by 'eth')
- [WEI_AMOUNT] = `10`

```bash
# Open a new terminal window

# Send lock transaction with default parameters
yarn peggy:lock --default

# Send lock transaction with custom parameters
yarn peggy:lock [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] [TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] [WEI_AMOUNT]
```

`yarn peggy:lock --default` expected output in Relayer console (terminal 4):

```bash
Witnessed new event: LogLock
Block number: 19

### Testing ERC20 token support

The bridge supports the transfer of ERC20 token assets. First, we'll deploy a sample TEST token to the network and then use it to test the feature.

```bash
# Mint 1,000 TEST tokens to your account for local use
yarn token:mint

# Approve 100 TEST tokens to the Bridge contract
yarn token:approve --default

# You can also approve a custom amount of TEST tokens to the Bridge contract:
yarn token:approve 11

# Get deployed TEST token contract address
yarn token:address

# Lock TEST tokens on the Bridge contract
# Note: ERC20 token locking requires 3 custom params and does not support the --default flag
yarn peggy:lock [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] [TEST_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] [TOKEN_AMOUNT]
```

`yarn peggy:lock` ERC20 expected output in ebrelayer console (with a `TOKEN_AMOUNT` of 11):

```bash
